## Data

### Load profiles

Our ComEd and Ameren Illinois data consists of kWh load profiles in 30-minute increments for the complete set of households across the entire Chicago metro area. To preserve anonymity, TK.

As a result, we only get consistent household identifiers for a given calendar month. Since Chicago's grid is summer-peaking, we choose load profiles for the month of TK. We denote load profiles as $L_i$ (for each $i$ household). Each $L_i$ is a TK point time series, for every 30 minutes in the month.

### Demographic information

The highest spatial resolution demographic data available for our analysis is the 5-year TK (2024?) US Census Bureau American Community Survey (2024 ACS) at the block group level. From this, we derive a number of block-group level demographic features:

* TK

### Geographical crosswalk

Load profiles are identified by ZIP+4. Our demographic information from the TK (2024?) ACS is available at the Census block group level. To join the two, we use a crosswalk from Melissa. TK details of crosswalk.

TK ZIP+4 and Census Block group spaital overlap to show that it's a reasonable mapping.

### Clusters

We cluster the load profiles into clusters via k-means. We use Euclidean distance on normalized load profiles, to focus on load shape rather than overall levels. We are aiming for a small number of clusters (4-10) to aid in interpretation. We chose $k=\textrm{TK}$ via the gap statistic [@tibshiraniEstimatingNumberClusters2001], using the `GapStatistics` package(TK citation).

## Demographic predictors of load profile mix

We begin by aggregating load profile clusters at the block group level. If $j$ is the block group, and $q$ is the cluster $(q\in\{1,\ldots,k\})$, then

$$C_{jq} = \sum_{i\in \textrm{bg(j)}}\textrm{I}(c_i = q)$$

is the count of households per cluster in each block group. We further normalize these to $\pi_{jq} = \frac{C_{jq}}{\sum_qC_{jq}}$, the proportion of cluster assignments in each block group.

Our aim is to understand how block group level demographics predict the load cluster mix. To that end, we fit a series of multinomial logistic regression models, estimating the log probabilty of a cluster assignment relative to our baseline cluster 1,

$$
\log\left(\frac{\pi_{jq}}{\pi_{jK}}\right) = \beta_{0q} + \beta_{1q} \cdot \textrm{median\_income}_q + \beta_{2q} \textrm{pct\_hispanic}_q + \ldots
$$

for each $q\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. We use the `MNLogit` function in the Python package `statsmodels` to fit these models.
